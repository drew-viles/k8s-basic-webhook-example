# Kubernetes Basic Webhook

This is just a basic webhook I've written to enforce labels on a pod.
It's not going to be developed into anything more than it is as it's just an example being used on my [YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnKy4XevqUM8fWHuvpcgHwA8tmmvd5WLZ&si=hgogC_HPeImOkg5e).
